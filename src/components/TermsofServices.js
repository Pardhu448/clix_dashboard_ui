            circumstances users of the Site who are repeat copyright infringers.
            CLIx reserves the right at any time in their sole discretion to
            cancel, delay, reschedule or alter the format of any course offered
            through CLIx, or to cease providing any part or all of the Site
            content or related services, and you agree that CLIx will not have

            Privacy Policy together constitute the entire agreement between you

            exercise or enforce any right or provision of these ToS shall not
            constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of
            these ToS is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
            invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should
            endeavour to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in
            the provision and the other provisions of these ToS shall remain in
            full force and effect. <br />  <br/> Choice of Law/Forum Selection: You
